A Netlogo model of an international organization composed of member states with changing preferences

This model is being developed as part of Dr. Emily Ritter's research on how international organizations change over time.
Because the model is still in development, there will be relatively frequent commits with the latest updates to the model mechanics
and their implementation. For a more in depth overview of how everything works, read the Info section of the Netlogo file.
